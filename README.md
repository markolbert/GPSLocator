# GPSLocator

GPSLocator is a simple Windows desktop app for interacting with your GPS device. It currently supports Garmin's InReach, and  lets you keep track of a device's last known location, and its history of tracking points and messages.

Garmin, InReach and associated trademarks are copyright Garmin.

*You must have a **professional-level** InReach account for the app to work. Standard personal accounts do not offer access to the web-based APIs InReachLocator requires.*

Documentation on using the app is [available here](https://www.jumpforjoysoftware.com/gpslocator-user-docs/).

Developer documentation will be forthcoming.
