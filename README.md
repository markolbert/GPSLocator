GPSLocator is a simple Windows desktop app for interacting with your GPS device. It currently supports Garmin's InReach, and  lets you keep track of a device's last known location, and its history of tracking points and messages.

*You must have a **professional-level** InReach account for the app to work. Standard personal accounts do not offer access to the web-based APIs InReachLocator requires.*
