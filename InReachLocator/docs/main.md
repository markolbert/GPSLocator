InReachLocator is a simple Windows desktop app for interacting with your InReach account. It lets you keep track of an InReach device's last known location, and its 31 day history of tracking points and messages.

*You must have a **professional-level** InReach account for the app to work. Standard personal accounts do not offer access to the web-based APIs InReachLocator requires.*
