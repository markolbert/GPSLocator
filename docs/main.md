GPSLocator is a simple Windows desktop app for interacting with GPS devices. Currently the Garmin InReach is supported. It lets you keep track of a device's last known location, and its history of tracking points and messages.

*You must have a **professional-level** InReach account for the app to work with InReach devices. Standard personal accounts do not offer access to the web-based APIs InReachLocator requires.*
